        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>“Maester Luwin sent Poxy Tym down to the kitchens, and they dined in the solar on cheese, capons, and brown oatbread. While tearing apart a bird with fat fingers, Lord Wyman made polite inquiry after Lady Hornwood, who was a cousin of his.” -A Game of Thrones</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups boiling water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup molasses</li>
            <li>2 Tbs. butter</li>
            <li>1 cup rolled oats (not the instant variety)</li>
            <li>1 Tbs. yeast</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. coarse salt</li>
            <li>~2 cups flour (you may need more or less depending on how much liquid your oats soaked up)</li>
            <li>1 Tbs. melted butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the boiling water with the molasses and butter, stirring to combine.</li>
            <li>Pour this over the rolled oats, and let sit for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>When the mixture is warm to the touch, but not hot, stir in the yeast, and let sit for another 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>It should be very light and bubbly at this point.</li>
            <li>Add the salt, followed gradually by the flour, until the dough no longer sticks to the sides of the bowl.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough to a clean, greased bowl, and brush the top with melted butter to keep from drying out.</li>
            <li>After the dough has doubled in bulk, transfer it to a bread pan, brush the top with butter, and let it rise again until doubled.</li>
            <li>Bake at 350 for ~40 minutes, when the bread should be a nice golden brown.</li>
            <li>Allow to cool for at least 30 minutes before taking it out of the pan and slicing. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
